# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
Understand housing market data
Compare housing market data to CPI and earnings data
Choose best metrics to compare, get data into usable format, and output the results using visualizations in Tableau

## Process
Explore data
Begin plotting simple data from the HPI index (house v land)
Explore trends over time and statistical differences between the measures.
Explore different variables with forecasting and the different results they produce
Take data from excel and manually wrangle to get city names that Tableau would recognize, and composite housing data for 2020
Create heatmap
Normalize JSON for earnings data and convert to .csv, compare this to housing data
Explore CPI data, visualize differences between different measures of CPI using calculated fields
Compare CPI data to housing data


## Results
Option 1. I created mostly line graphs as these are simple and not unnecessarily taxing on the eye. They do the job, so while it would have been fun to play around with different types of visualizations, I thought this would be detrimental to the clarity of the presentation.  I also used a heatmap to show the relative geographical pricing so that the different areas can be easily visualized.

## Challenges 
Dates in inconsistent formats throughout a worksheet (took me a while to figure out what the problem was with my graphs)
Getting the JSON data for the CPI into a csv/xls format

## Future Goals
More analysis of why standard deviations for houses v land diverges in 2021 and how this compares to other statistical measures, eg the mean
Analysis of whether more people are moving to urban centres over time and how this affects house prices
Analysis of housing types - their changing popularity and price over time (i.e. are more people moving into apartments?)
How does changing the different calculations for CPI change the CPI values?
